Ever since my first contact with BioCure Health through Dr Rosado, I could not have had a better experience. The sense of being understood and the feeling that your problem is the only one in the world is crucial . Knowing that there is always somebody ready to respond to your questions is extremely important when you need an answer on the moment. I could not be more satisfied with my experience and I'm looking forward the development of my treatment

I am so thankful to the BioCure team for the amazing improvement in my health and my lifestyle. In a little over a month I am already loosing weight and feeling much better and healthier. Dr. Rosado and Claudia always follow up with me regarding my treatment plan to make sure I am meeting my goals and if I have any questions or concerns. I highly recommend their services.

Dr.Chaple and Dr.Rosado are not only excellent Practitioners, but wonderful individuals as well. They go above and beyond for their patients, making sure they are well informed and treated with top level care. I always leave the clinic feeling my best both physically and emotionally. The staff is kind and motivated, their customer service is proof of their love for the clinic and it’s mission. If you are looking for Doctor’s that assess their patients as a whole rather than just their symptoms, then BioCure will not disappoint. I highly recommend their services.

BioCure has one of the best customer service I have experienced in this industry. My mother and I went there after we got rear-ended at a red light. The tactical team doctors and personnel, did not waste any time in preparing an effective action plan and in taking care of us.

Each visit is a better experience. They truly show care and concern about the client's physical progress, in regards to every single client.

At BioCure you'll feel right at home!

Everyone here is very friendly and make you feel so welcomed. Dr. Vanessa Chapel gave me injections with oxygen needed to my ankle and shoulder she was gentle and made me feel comfortable. Dr. Joaquin Rosario is attentive to your concern and explains everything so patiently. I feel confident that all my treatments will make me feel better soon. My blood work came back with a few deficiencies. So he started me on an I/V containing a cocktail of vitamins especially for my needs. I walked out of there feeling more energy right away. Then finally I can started the PRP on my shoulder and ankle. Where I had tears in my tendons. In 3 months after 2 PRP injections. No tears found on the next MRI. So now he recommended Physical Therapy to regain movement on my shoulder. It was amazing to me. I recommend you come in and just get a consultation you will be glad you did.
